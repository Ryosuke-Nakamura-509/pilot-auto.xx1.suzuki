# How to contribute to AutowareArchitectureProposal

Thank you for your interest in improving the AutowareArchitectureProposal repository! As this repository is simply a mirror of a private repository, created to propose a new Autoware reference implementation to the [Autoware Foundation](https://www.autoware.org/), issues and pull requests are not accepted.

If you are interested in developing Autoware, then consider contributing to the [Autoware.Auto project](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto) instead. All Autoware development and user discussion takes place within that repository, and everyone is welcome to create issues and merge requests!

Before making any contributions to the Autoware.Auto project, please make sure to review the [contributor's guide](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/contributors-guide.html), and please refrain from asking questions about the AutowareArchitectureProposal repository via ROS Answers or an Autoware.Auto issue.
